# OS_Project
This project consists of two programs related to the concept of Operating System.

The first program i.e. Ques. 10 is based on the Multilevel Queue Scheduling which will schedule 
the processes on the basis of pre-emptive shortest remaining time first algorithm.

The Second program i.e. Ques. 21 is based on the scenario of Demand Paging (or Demand paged memory) in which
  Maximum acceptable page-fault rate is calculated.
